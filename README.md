## Intro
This was a group design project of overhauling the aerodynamic package of the Loughborough FS car. I was responsible for the design of the front section of the car.

## Aims and Objectives
The aims and objectives are in accordance with the issues found on the current package of the FS car. Those issues would be:
* Air stalling at the front wing
* Lack of airflow going to the underbody and sidepods
* Air leaking up the side of the chassis towards the driver
* Overly-aggressive flaps structure that hinder the airflow drownstream

For that reason, the design aims and objectives are listed here:
1. Increase airflow to the underbody
1. Avoid flow stalling
1. Simplify the front wing design
1. Maintain or improve the lift and drag coefficients
1. Reduce yaw sensitivity of front wing

## New Front Wing Design
The old front wing is shown in the top image. The new design created space under the nose for the air to go towards the diffusers that is more than double the one in the current car (see bottom image). The number of flaps was also reduced and simplified to be in accordance with the new sidepods placement. The endplates of the car were also switched from a blocking structure into a deflecting structure at 30 degrees to send the airflow outwards of the front wheels.

The top images show a CFD analysis of the old design and the botttom ones show it for the new design. It is seen that in the new concept the flow is conditioned better for the sidepods and downstream, that it doesn't leak in the sides of the chassis and that the diffuser is receiving it better.

## Overall Results
Taking into consideration the redesign of the front wing and the adjustments made by the mid and rear groups as well, the overall drag and lift coefficients of the car were calculated and compared with the initial values from the old design in the table below. Individually, the front wing had lower lift and drag coefficients because of the more simplistic design. However, that design helped the other parts of the vehicle gain downforce, which overall gave a higher lift coefficient (see table below).
